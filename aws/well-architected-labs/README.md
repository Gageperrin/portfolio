# AWS Well-Architected Labs
[AWS Well-Architected Labs](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/) provide hands-on experience with a wide variety of AWS technologies on a number of different levels.

As part of my portfolio, I am writing out the steps for each lab and providing any commentary or analysis of what is produced. For some labs, I will build CloudFormation templates for viewers to use to test out my solutions to various projects on this website.
